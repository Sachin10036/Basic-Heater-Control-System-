# Basic Heater Control System â€“ Embedded Systems Intern Assignment

This project simulates a simple heater control system using an **Arduino Uno**, a **DHT22** temperature sensor, a **buzzer**, a **16x2 I2C LCD**, and an **LED** as the heater. It includes real-time temperature monitoring, a state-based control system, and overheat protection, all managed using **Timer1 interrupt**.

##  Overview

The **Heater Control System** monitors ambient temperature using the DHT22 sensor. Based on predefined temperature ranges, it changes system states such as *Idle*, *Heating*, *Target Reached*, and *Overheat*. It controls an LED (heater), a buzzer (overheat alert), and displays live data on an I2C LCD. Timer1 is used to interrupt every second to ensure periodic sensor readings without using `delay()`.
